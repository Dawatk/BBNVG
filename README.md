# BBNVG #
Bootleg Bootleg Night Vision Goggles adopted from BPNVG V2 by Stubbs

# Description:
I've wanted to build a set of active night vision goggles for a while and once I found the BPNVG by stubbs (later picked up by justcallmekoko on github for bino adaptation), I started building.

This repo is my space to track any problems I encounter, changes I make, or parts that I've found can work as replacements if things aren't available.
